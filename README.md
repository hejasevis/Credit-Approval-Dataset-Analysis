🧠 Features  
- Data Imputation: Handling missing values using advanced imputation techniques.  
- Feature Subset Selection: Identifying the most relevant features to improve model efficiency.  
- Classifier Comparison: Evaluating multiple machine learning models for credit approval prediction.  
- Modern Tools: Leveraging Python libraries like Pandas, Scikit-learn, and Seaborn for analysis and visualization.  

🚀 How It Works  
1. Data Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the dataset, including handling missing values and encoding categorical variables.  
2. Feature Selection: Apply techniques like correlation analysis, PCA, or recursive feature elimination to select the best features.  
3. Model Training: Train and evaluate classifiers such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and SVM.  
4. Performance Comparison: Compare models based on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.  

🛠️ Technologies Used  
- Python for data analysis and modeling.  
- Pandas and NumPy for data manipulation.  
- Scikit-learn for machine learning algorithms.  
- Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization.  

📈 Goals  
- Improve the accuracy of credit approval predictions.  
- Demonstrate the impact of data imputation and feature selection on model performance.  
- Provide a clear and reproducible workflow for similar datasets.  

🚧 Limitations  
- The dataset has a limited number of features, which may restrict the complexity of the analysis.  
- Results may vary depending on the imputation and feature selection techniques used.
